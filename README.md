## Enhance Your Dynamics Customer Insights – Journeys Lead Forms with Geolocation Autofill for WordPress

For consultants working with Dynamics Customer Insights - Journeys, creating and embedding optimized lead forms is essential for capturing accurate, relevant data. This WordPress plugin is designed to streamline that process by adding geolocation autofill functionality to lead forms embedded on your website.

When a visitor opens your WordPress page containing a lead form with the required fields `address1_postalcode` and `address1_city`, this plugin prompts the visitor’s browser to detect their location. Upon consent, the plugin automatically fills in the postal code and city fields based on the visitor's current location. This minimizes user effort, improves data accuracy, and enhances the overall user experience on your site.

## Key Features
1. Flexible Embedding Options: Choose between two integration methods based on your site’s needs:

   - Site-wide Embedding: Apply the geolocation autofill script across all pages where lead forms appear, ensuring a consistent experience for all visitors.
   - Shortcode-based Embedding: Use a customizable shortcode to add the geolocation functionality precisely where you want it—ideal for targeted pages or specific form placements.

2. Multilingual Support: The plugin’s interface is available in both English and German, catering to a wider range of users and enhancing usability for consultants and teams across regions.

This plugin is an invaluable tool for consultants aiming to boost lead form efficiency and quality in Dynamics Customer Insights – Journeys. Enhance your forms with effortless location-based autofill and ensure that every lead submission captures precise and meaningful data.
